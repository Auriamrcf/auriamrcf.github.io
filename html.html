            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <h2>My self-summary</h2>
            <p>I've been changing a lot. For instance, I used to have strong political beliefs, but now I don't really stand for any ideology and I get bored when somebody does.
            </p>
            <p>I'm passionate about technology, self-development, science, rational debate, good stories (in any format - books, movies) and good conversation about interesting subjects.
            </p>
            <p>Althought I have a very rational view of the world, I'm very intense, and I love feeling that I share a deep connection with someone.
            </p>
